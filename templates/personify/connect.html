          <h3>What is a personality profile?</h3>
          <p>
            Contemporary psychologists believe that there are 5 basic dimensions of personality. They are often
            referred to as the Big Five personality traits. This widely examined theory suggests five dimensions
            to describe human personality. They are Openness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and
            Emotional range.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of them has underlying dimensions and can be measured on the scale of 1 to 100%.
            For example 10% on the "Prone to worry" scale means the person is in the 10% of people least likely to
            be affected by worries.

            <h3>How it works?</h3>
            <p>
              The engine behind this concept uses linguistic analysis to infer individuals' personality characteristics.
              In other words, the system looks at the choice of words in some text written by a person - be it a blog post
              or a Tweet - and depending on those words, builds a profile on the Big Five traits, as well as Needs and Values.
            </p>

              The service behind it is powered by IBM. If you're curious, you can check out
              <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/personality-insights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">their documentation</a>.
              Needless to say, we've made sure to tune all the right knobs, so no data is stored by them.

              We want to demonstrate how modern algorithms can be used to infer user's preferences, tastes and even
              character. We hope this can be used as force for good, improving user experience and driving
              new innovative products that benefit the wider society.

              At the same time, we believe personal wellbeing tools have great potential. This simple demo shows
              how software can be used to track things beyond just external factors such as activity level and fitness,
              and look into one's personality. Every person is unique.
